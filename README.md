# React Flash Cards

This a React-based upcycle of an old Treehouse Project. The inital project was implemented using Node, Express, and Pug.

I've refactored the app to be a fully client-side implementation using React.

# To Do

1. Break the app into components.
2. Add flip functionality
3. Add state
4. Add next functionality
5. Add mock authentication
6. Attempting to deploy
